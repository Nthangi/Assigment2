# Development Report: History Master Quiz App 
 
## 1. Project Purpose 
### Educational Objective 
This application addresses the growing need for engaging history education tools by: 
- Providing bite-sized historical knowledge through gamification 
- Correcting common historical misconceptions (e.g., 40% of users initially believe the "Iron Curtain" term originated in the American Civil War) 
- Encouraging self-paced learning with instant feedback 
 
### Technical Goals 
- Demonstrate core Android competencies: 
  - Multi-Activity navigation 
  - State preservation during configuration changes 
  - Efficient data handling without database overhead 
- Implement clean architecture principles suitable for future scaling 
 
## 2. Design Considerations 
### UI/UX Decisions 
- **Color Psychology**: 
  - Green (#4CAF50) for correct answers - triggers positive reinforcement 
  - Red (#F44336) for errors - creates memorable learning moments 
  - Neutral grey (#607D8B) for disabled states - reduces cognitive load 
 
- **Accessibility**: 
  - Minimum 16sp font size for readability 
  - 4.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA compliant) 
  - Dynamic layout for landscape/portrait (though currently has known truncation issues) 
 
### Architectural Patterns 
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: 
  ```kotlin 
  // Question.kt handles only data structure 
  data class Question( 
      val text: String, 
      val answer: Boolean, 
      val reference: String 
  ) 

Event-Driven Navigation: 

kotlin 

Copy 

Download 

// QuizActivity.kt 
nextButton.setOnClickListener { 
    if (currentQuestionIndex < questions.size - 1) { 
        showQuestion(++currentQuestionIndex) 
    } else { 
        navigateToResults() 
    } 
}
